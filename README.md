# Sentiment Analysis and Portfolio Optimization for Tesla and Bitcoin

## Project Overview

This project explores **Sentiment Analysis** and **Portfolio Optimization** using financial data from **Tesla (TSLA)** and **Bitcoin (BTC)**. By combining sentiment data from Twitter with historical stock prices, we developed **LSTM models** to predict the impact of public sentiment on Tesla's daily stock returns and Bitcoin valuations. The project is an application of **financial data science**, utilizing machine learning and NLP to optimize investment strategies.

## Features

- **Sentiment Analysis**: Conducted sentiment analysis on Twitter data related to Tesla and Bitcoin, using NLP techniques to derive sentiment scores.
- **LSTM Model**: Constructed and evaluated Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models for predicting the stock returns and price movements based on sentiment data.
- **Portfolio Optimization**: Developed two-asset portfolio optimization strategies, integrating the predictive capabilities of the sentiment models to inform investment decisions.
- **Financial Data Science**: This project serves as a case study in the application of machine learning and NLP in financial markets.

## Technologies

- **Python**: For data processing and model implementation.
- **NLTK**: For Natural Language Processing and sentiment analysis.
- **TensorFlow**: For constructing and training the LSTM models.
